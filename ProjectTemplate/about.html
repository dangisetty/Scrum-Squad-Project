			<h1>About the Scrum Squad Project</h1>

			<p>
				The Scrum Squad Project is a collaborative platform designed to improve
				communication between employees and company leadership.
				Our goal is to create a transparent, structured way for organizations
				to listen, respond, and improve.
			</p>

            <h1></h1>

			<p>
				Employees are empowered to provide meaningful, actionable feedback
				about workplace challenges, processes, and overall company culture.
				At the same time, company administrators can track trends, identify
				priority issues, and share progress updates on how those concerns
				are being addressed.
			</p>

            <h1></h1>

			<p>
				By visualizing feedback and progress in one centralized system,
				Scrum Squad helps organizations move beyond one-time surveys and
				toward continuous improvement driven by real employee input.
			</p>
